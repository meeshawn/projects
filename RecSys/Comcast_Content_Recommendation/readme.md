## Implemented 3 Neural Network based Deep Ranking Architectures for the Carousel Ranking Project on
Comcast’s X1/Flex streaming platform using TensorFlow(TF), TF Recommenders, & TF Ranking packages:
- Two-Tower Softmax model: (User Tower & Candidates Tower) Obtained NDCG ≈ 0.7 and MRR ≈ 0.6.
- Single-Tower Softmax model: (User Tower only) Obtained NDCG ≈ 0.6 and MRR ≈ 0.5.
- Two-Tower Binary model: (User Tower & Clicked Candidate Tower) Obtained an overall accuracy ≈ 89%
