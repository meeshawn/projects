## Text Summarization using PageRank Algorithm

Built a graph-based text summarization system using PageRank algorithm that models each sentence in a text document as a node in an undirected graph and iteratively
computes a weighted score for all the nodes in the graph. Sentences corresponding to the top ’N’ weighted scores are selected as the summary of the given text document.
