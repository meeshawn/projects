## Parts of Speech Tagger using a Hidden-Markov model and the Viterbi Algorithm

Built a Hidden-Markov model based stochastic tagger in python that assigns parts-of-speech tags to words in a sentence using maximum likelihood estimation and the Viterbi algorithm. The tags have been assigned to words from the famous Penn Treebank. The scripts trains the model on a document drawn from various sources, which have been manually annotated with part-of-speech tags.
