## Sentence Segmentation using Decision Trees

Built a Decision Tree based classifier in python that labels periods and other punctuations encountered in a sentence as either end-of-sentence or not-end-of-sentence.
The Training has been done on subsets of the Treebank dataset, consisting of documents drawn from various sources, which have been manually tokenized and annotated with sentence boundaries.
