## Parts of Speech Tagger using a Hidden-Markov model and the Viterbi Algorithm

The python script implements the Viterbi algorithm for part-of-speech tagging. The tags have been assigned to words from the famous Penn Treebank. The scripts trains the model on a document drawn from various sources, which have been manually annotated with part-of-speech tags.
