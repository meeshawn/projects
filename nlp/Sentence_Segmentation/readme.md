## Sentence Segmentation using Decision Trees

The python script detects sentence boundaries in text. Precisely, the script predicts whether a period (.) encountered in the text is the end of a sentence or not. The Training has been done on subsets of the Treebank dataset, consisting of documents drawn from various sources, which have been manually tokenized and annotated with sentence boundaries.
